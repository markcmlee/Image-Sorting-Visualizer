# Image Sorting Visualizer

Although there are a ton of sorting visualizers on the internet, it is rare to come across one that handles images, or 2D arrays.

Users must first specify their desired number of rows and columns (ranges from 5 - 20), and a link to an image
(Chrome: right click -> copy image address | FireFox: right click -> copy image location)

After submitting these details, the image will be randomized, and the user can select up to 5 different sorting algorithms.
(Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Quick, Heap)

After the sorting method executes, the time it took to complete, as well as the total number of swaps completed are displayed.
